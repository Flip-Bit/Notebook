We are going to get a bunch of TFTP session timed out errors, just keep hitting enter until they go away.  This gets corrected in a later step...

Enable all of our previous changes
```bash
enable 
```

Now we need to escalate to the configure terminal level so we can start making configuration changes.

If youve ever played with Cisco stuff, this is config t
```bash
configure terminal
## OR
config t
```

Now we can fix the TFTP session timeout message
```bash
ip dhcp-client disable
```

Give the switch its permanent IP address.  By default, everything is on vlan 1, this will have our switch operating like an ordinary switch.  We also need to give VLAN 1 its on virtual interface
```bash
vlan 1
router-interface ve 1
exit
```

Give the Virtual Interface an address outside of your DHCP server range. (Do a ping to verify the IP is unused)

You can also use AngryIP Scanner to verify your DHCP range

```bash
interface ve 1 
ip address 10.2.2.32/24 
exit 
write mem
```

The basic configuration is now complete.  Now we can use the assigned IP to configure our switch!

Unplug the ethernet connection from the management port.

Plug it back in to a regular switch port.
