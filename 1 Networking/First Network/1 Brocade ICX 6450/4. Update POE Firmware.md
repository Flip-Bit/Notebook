Startup the TFTP server if you shut it down.

Exit config mode
```
exit
```

Install Firmware
```
inline power install-firmware stack-unit 1 tftp 10.2.2.77 ICX64xx/icx64xx_poeplus_02.1.0.b004.fw
```

Give it a minute, then press Enter to return to CLI

Save the changes & Reload the switch
```
write memory
reload
```

You will probably get this, just means to give it more time

Once the reload command takes, your switch will reboot.  Once the reboot is complete we can enable our changes and navigate back into config t
```
enable
config t
```

Yay, we now have the most current POE firmware


This is the bare minimum for a working switch.  Next we will do further configurations followed by licensing of the switch.
