If you have made it this far, there are a few assumptions that are being made

1. You already completed all steps before this
2. You are no longer connected to the management port, rather a regular port.
3. You already have a Putty session established, and you are currently in config t (last command from previous lesson)

Currently, our switch is running as a "dumb" switch.  Nothing further needs done if thats all you are after.  If you want to make it a bit smarter, please continue!

Before we can SSH to our switch or access the web UI we first need the following.
1. Generate an RSA keypair
```bash
crypto key zeroize
crypto key generate rsa modulus 2048
```

2. Secure the switch with a username and password
```bash
username <username> password <password>
```
![[Pasted image 20240121133504.png]]

3. Tell the switch to use our newly created local user to authorize logins to the webUI
```bash
aaa authentication login default local
aaa authentication web default local
```

4. Disable Telnet
```bash
no telnet server
```
![[Pasted image 20240121133624.png]]

5. Password protect the Serial port
```bash
enable aaa console
```
![[Pasted image 20240121133643.png]]

6. Unless you really need/want to use the WebUI, disable it
```
no web-management http
```
![[Pasted image 20240121133748.png]]

7.  **OPTIONAL**: If you still want the WebUI, but want it over HTTPS instead of the default HTTP
```
crypto-ssl certificate generate
web-management https
```
![[Pasted image 20240121133952.png]]
You can now access the Web UI w/ HTTPS

***
Require Key Based SSH Access and disable Password login

```bash
ip ssh key-authentication yes
ip ssh password-authentication no
ip ssh interactive-authentication no
```

Download Puttygen to create a key pair
https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/w64/puttygen.exe

Generate an RSA 2048 keypair, save both public and private keys.

Place the public key onto your TFTP server. import it with the following
```
ip ssh pub-key-file tftp 10.2.2.77 public.key
```
![[Pasted image 20240121145932.png]]

Load the key using pageant
https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html

Using Putty, try to SSH to the Switch

***
Give the Switch a Name / Get Rid of the Serial Cable

Give the switch a name
```bash
hostname ghostswitch
```
![[Pasted image 20240121143730.png]]

If you are able to SSH to the switch you can now remove the Serial cable.  If it makes you feel better, disconnect both the SSH session and the cable, then try to SSH back to the switch, just to be sure.

if you can SSH to the switch you should see something like this

Default Routes & DNS

Escalate to config t
```
enable
config t
```

Set the DNS server to your router.  I have a server running as my DNS server so I checked on my firewall what was being used
```
ip dns server-address 10.2.2.4
ip route 0.0.0.0/0 10.2.2.4
```

Sync time with NTP servers
```
clock winter-time
clock timezone gmt GMT-05 
ntp 
disable serve 
server 216.239.35.0 
server 216.239.35.4 
exit
```
