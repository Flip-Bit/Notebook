We are plugging in a POE AP on port 1
```
interface ethernet 1/1/1
inline power
exit
```
I got a fault when trying with port 1, so I switched to 5
```
interface ethernet 1/1/5
```

To view inline power
```
show inline power
```

Now we can write our changes to memory and continue with the AP configuration!!

First, we should take care of licensing...

```
write mem
```
