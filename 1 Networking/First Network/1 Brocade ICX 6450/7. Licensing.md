If you followed everything up until now, the following should be all you need to do.

```
enable
hw pid-prom serial 2ax5o2jk68e
hw pid-prom clear-sw-lid
reload
```

The switch will reboot, when its back online, it should have a new license ID and serial

Once back online, reconnect, via TFTP send over the license files
```
enable 
copy tftp license 10.2.2.77 ICX64xx/1-6450-prem.xml unit 1 
copy tftp license 10.2.2.77 ICX64xx/2-6450-ports.xml unit 1
```

Verify a proper import
```
show license
```

If the status column says active. good job.


Write to memory and reload
```
write mem
reload
```

Upon reload, you'll have a fully licensed Brocade :)
