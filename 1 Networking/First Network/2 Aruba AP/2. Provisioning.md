After the factory reset process is complete we can continue..

Get back into APBoot

Disable the SSID from broadcasting to the surrounding world....

```bash
setenv disable_prov_ssid 1
saveenv
reset
```
The device will reboot once again

Get back into APBoot

Assign an IP, subnet, and default gateway
```bash
setenv ipaddr 10.2.2.254
setenv netmask 255.255.255.0
setenv gatewayip 10.2.2.1
save
```

Verify Changes and reboot your switch
```bash
printenv
reset
```

This time, let it fully boot up.

 Within a browser, navigate to the IP address assigned to the AP upon full boot (Look at the lights...)
