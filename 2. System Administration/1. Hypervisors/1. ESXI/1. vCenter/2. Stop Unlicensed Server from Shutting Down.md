This one works on older Server versions, if you are using 2019 or newer, drop down to the next method.  If you are using something older than that, and this still doesn't work. drop down to the next one..

After your Windows server license expires (Atleast when on a VM) it will shut down every hour this can be stopped though.  How?  Check it out...

WLMS is the Windows Licensing Monitoring Service.  Delete that Bitch!!

1. Open CMD

Another way. Still for older versions

2. Navigate to- HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE->System->CurrentControlSet->Services
3. Locate ```HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\WLMS```
4. Right click WLMS --> Permissions
5. Change Owner to admin
6. Under the security tab, verify admin has full control
7. Change the Start value to 4
