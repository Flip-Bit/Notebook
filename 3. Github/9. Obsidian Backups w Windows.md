8. Once inside the directory housing our notes, we can start following the instructions from GitHub.
```bash
echo "# Notebook" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/Flip-Bit/Notebook.git
git push -u origin main
```

Since my notebook is saved on a different device, I get the following when I try to run `git add .`
![[Pasted image 20240204153942.png]]

Just gotta run the command git gives us.  Then add our files to the repo.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/Flip-Bit/Notebook.git
git push -u origin main
```
