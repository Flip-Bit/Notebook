```

***
## Useful Commands

See current branch:
```bash
git branch
```

View modified files:
```bash
git status
```

View current directory:
```bash
pwd
```

View files in current directory:
```bash
ls
ls -a #Also view hidden files/folders -a = all
```

Add previously untracked files to Git:
```bash
git add <Filename>

Username/password authentication is no longer allowed, because..... security

We need a token...

***
## Create a Personal Access Token (PAT)

1. Verify GitHub version, must be >= 2.31.1
```bash
git --version
```

2. Configure your username, this is what will be shown when you contribute code
```bash
git config --global user.name "FlipBit"
```
![[Pasted image 20240130133758.png]]

3. Configure global email
```bash
git config --global user.email "Your@email.com"
```
![[Pasted image 20240130133931.png]]

4. Configure Credential Helper
```bash
git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain
```
![[Pasted image 20240130134049.png]]

5. Verify configurations
```bash
git config -l
```
![[Pasted image 20240130134146.png]]

## Git Flow

```bash
git status
git add <filename>
git commit -m "Something relevant"
git push origin <branch-name>
```


***
## Fetch a Branch

**Fetch**: will pull down any changes to a repo without modifying your existing code on local.
**Pull**: Fully updates your local repo

```bash
git pull origin main #Make sure local and remote are in sync
git fetch origin <branch name> #Grab changes on remote without changing local
git checkout <branch-name>
git branch
```

***
## Creating a Pull Request

1. Navigate to the Github Repo you would like to merge with main

2. Navigate to your branch
![[Pasted image 20240131140953.png]]

3. Open a Pull request
![[Pasted image 20240131141101.png]]

4. Create Pull request
![[Pasted image 20240131141128.png]]

5. Once Approved, you'll have the option to merge with main, if there are any conflicts, GitHub will let you know and give you the chance to correct them before merging.
6. Once merged, delete your branch.  It has ***served its purpose***.
