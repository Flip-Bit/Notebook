"Decision structures, also called decision trees, conditional statements, or if/else statements, are fundamental to computer programming. Conditional statements are a sequence of well-defined instructions that produce a unique output based on the value of the input. Conditionals follow a flowchart-like structure and allow for logic within the code." https://github.com/learn-academy-2024-alpha/syllabus/blob/main/javascript/conditionals.md

## JavaScript Operators

We learned in the previous lesson that Boolean is a primitive data type.  It comes out as either ```true``` or ```false```.  Boolean can be useful when evaluating data.

#### Three JavaScript Evaluation Categories
1. Equality
2. Relational
3. Logical

**Equality Operators**: Will compare two values  and then let us know if the values equal the same thing or not.  If they do we will get back a ```true``` otherwise ```false```

There are two types of equality operators

**Loose Equality Operator**: ```==``` 
Best effort to convert two value types to the same data type and then make an equation.

Example:
```js
true == false
// output: false

3 == "3"
// output: true

"3" == 1 + 2
// output: true
```

**Strict Equality Operator**: ```===```
Evaluates "as is".  Meaning it does not attempt to change data types.  If the data types are the same, and they equal the same value, we will get ```true``` otherwise, ```false```

Best practice says we should **ALWAYS** use Strict Equality Operators.

Example:
```js
true === false
// output: false

3 === "3"
// output: false

"3" === 1 + 2
// output: false
```


**Relational Operators**: Evaluates numeric values for their relative magnitude and returns a Boolean value.  Most common Relational Operators are: 
* Greater than: ```>```
* Less than: ```<```
* Greater than or equal to: ```>=```
* Less than or equal to: ```<=```

Example:
```js
// greater than
2 > 0
// output: true

// less than
4 < 4 + 4
// output: true

// greater than or equal to
0 >= 2
// output: false

// less than or equal to
4 <= 0.8
// output: **true**
```


**Logical Operators**: Takes two full statements and then links them together to give back a single evaluation of ```true``` or ```false```

There are three types of Logical Operators:
1. ```logical AND``` denoted with ```&&```
2. ```logical OR``` denoted with ```||```
3. ```negation``` denoted with ```|```

## Logical AND
Can take two or more full evals and then states that all statements need to be true for the entire statement to be declared true.

Examples:
```js
true && false
// output: false

true && true
// output: true

6 > 5 && 7 > 4
// output: true

6 > 5 && 7 < 4
// output: false

"hi" === "HI".toLowerCase() && 4 > 3 && 8 >= 8
// output: true
```

## Logical OR
Takes two or more complete evals and lets us know if at the least, one statement must be true for the entire statement to be true.

Examples:
```js
true || false
// output: true

true || true
// output: true

false || false
// output: false

4 > 2 || 3 === "3"
// output: true

"hi" === "HI" || false || 8 >= 10
// output: false
```

## Negation
Takes a statement, returns the opposite.  Used by adding a **bang** operator at the beginning of a statement.

**Bang Operator**: ```!```

Examples:
```js
!true
// output: false

!false
// output: true

!(true && false)
// output: true

!(true && true)
// output: false
```

We can also replace one of the equal signs within an equality operator with a bang.  This is then called an **Inequality Operator**.

**Inequality Operator**: Evaluates whether the two values do not **NOT** equal the same thing.

Examples:
```js
true !== false
// output: true

true !== true
// output: false

5 !== 5
// output: false
```


## JavaScript Decisions

**Programming**: The art of solving complex problems by breaking it down into small manageable pieces.

**Conditional Statements**: Commands for handling decisions.  More precisely, **Conditional Statements** will perform different actions depending on the outcome of an evaluation. (True or False)

We can define a conditional statement in our code by using the ```if``` followed by ```()```
Example: ```if()```

Within the ```()``` we place our evaluation.  Once evaluated, we will get either a true or a false.  If true, within the code below, whats within the curly brackets will execute.

```js
if (this thing evaluates to true) {
  console.log(do this action)
}
```

An ```if``` statement is ALWAYS required for conditionals.  Once again, if the eval comes out true, whats in the curly braces will execute

```js
const car = "on" // <--- See why something WILL happen?

if (car === "on") {
  console.log("The engine is running.")
}
// output: "The engine is running."
```

If false, nothing happens
```js
const car = "off" // <---  See why nothing will happen?

if (car === "on") {
  console.log("The engine is running.")
}
// no output
```

## Else Statements
Minimum requirement for a conditional statement is an ```if```.  With just an if the code in our curly brackets will either be executed if ```true```, or nothing will happen if its ```false```

Sometimes this isn't good enough. Sometimes, a conditional will come back ```false``` and we need something other than nothing to happen.  In these situations, we can use an ```else``` statement.

Examples:
```js
if(this thing evaluates to true) {
  console.log(do this action)
} else {
  console.log(do this other action)
}
```

When the ```if``` statement comes back false, our ```else``` code will now execute
```js
const car = "off"

if (car === "on") {
  console.log("The engine is running.")
} else {
  console.log("The engine is off.")
}

// output: "The engine is off."
```


## Else If Statements
We can add EVEN MORE options within our decision tree.  One way is by using ```else if``` statements.

These statements will run after the initial ```if``` statements and before the ```else``` statement.

Examples:
```js
const car = "off"

if (car === "on") {
  console.log("The engine is running.")
} else if (car === "off") {
  console.log("The engine is off.")
} else {
  console.log("The car is broken.")
}
// output: "The engine is off."
```

When working with ```else if``` statements, we can add as many as we would like to our code.
```js
const number = 42

if (number === 42) {
  console.log("This is the answer to life, the universe, and everything")
} else if (number > 10) {
  console.log("The number is greater than 10")
} else if (number < 10) {
  console.log("The number is less than 10")
} else {
  console.log("Something went wrong")
}
// output: "This is the answer to life, the universe, and everything"
```

## String Interpolation 
Sometimes when executing code, we need an in-depth statement that can include variables as well as extra text characters.  **Template Literates**d also known as **String Interpolation** will allow variables to be embedded into strings.  Prior to **String Interpolation** the only way to add variables to a string was with **concatenation**

**Concatenation**:
```js
const number1 = 34
const number2 = 78
console.log(number1 + " is less than " + number2)
// output: "34 is less than 78"
```

String Interpolation is easier to read.  We can perform string interpolation by wrapping the entire string in backticks.  Once a string is inside our backticks, we can embed variables with ```${}```

**String Interpolation**:
```js
const number1 = 34
const number2 = 78
console.log(`${number1} is less than ${number2}`)
// output: "34 is less than 78"
```


## Conditional Statement Examples
Some extra examples:

**Example**: Write a statement that takes two variables and logs the one that has more letters.
```js
const fruit1 = "orange"
const fruit2 = "apple"

if (fruit1.length > fruit2.length) {
  console.log(`${fruit1} has more letters`)
} else if (fruit1.length < fruit2.length) {
  console.log(`${fruit2} has more letters`)
} else {
  console.log("They have the same letters")
}
// output: "orange has more letters"
```

**Example**: Write a statement that takes a number from 0 to 100 and logs the number of digits.
```js
const number = 9

if (number === 100) {
  console.log(`${number} is a triple digit number`)
} else if (number > 9 && number < 100) {
  console.log(`${number} is a double digit number`)
} else if (number >= 0 && number <= 9) {
  console.log(`${number} is a single digit number`)
} else {
  console.log("please enter a number from 0 to 100")
}
// output: "9 is a single digit number"
```

## Challenges 
Copy the challenges into your JavaScript file. Comment out the instructions and code the solution to each problem beneath the prompt.

Write the code that will log true or false for the following:

- Is 34 divided by 3 greater than 67 divided by 2? 
```js
var1 = 34 / 3
var2 = 67 / 2
if(var1 > var2){
console.log("var1 is greater than var2)
} else {
	console.log("var2 is greater than var1)
}
```

- Does 5 evaluate to the same as "5"?
- Does 5 strictly equal "5"?
- Does !3 strictly equal 3?
- Does `"LEARN".length` strictly equal 5 AND `"Student".length` strictly equal 7?
- Does `"LEARN".length` strictly equal 5 OR `"Student".length` strictly equal 10?
- Does `"LEARN"` contain the subset `"RN"`?
- Does `"LEARN"` contain the subset `"rn"`?
- Does `"LEARN"[0]` strictly equal `"l"`?
- Modify the code from the previous question to return `true`.

Write a conditional statement for the following prompts. Make sure you try different options and change the variables to ensure properly working code.

- Write a statement that takes a variable of item and logs "in budget" if a price is $100 or less.
- Write a statement that takes a variable of hungry and logs "eat food" if you are hungry and "keep coding" if you are not hungry.
- Write a statement that takes a variable of trafficLight and logs "go" if the light is green, "slow down" if the light is yellow and "stop" if the light is red.
- Write a statement that takes two variables that are numbers and outputs the larger number. If the numbers are equal, output "the numbers are the same".
- Write a statement that takes a variable of a number and logs whether the number is odd, even, or zero.

### [](https://github.com/learn-academy-2024-alpha/syllabus/blob/main/javascript/conditionals.md#-stretch-goals)🏔 Stretch Goals

Write a conditional statement for the following prompts.

- Write a statement that takes a variable of a grade percentage and logs the letter grade for that percentage, if the grade is 100% log "perfect score", if the grade is zero log "no grade available."
- Write a statement that takes a variable of a boolean, number, or string data type and logs the data type of the variable. **HINT**: Check out the [JavaScript typeof operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof).
- Create a password checker using a single conditional statement. If a user inputs a password with 12 or more characters AND the password includes `!`, then log "That is a mighty strong password!" If the user’s password is 8 or more characters OR includes `!`, then log "That password is strong enough." Log "That is not a valid password." for every other input.
