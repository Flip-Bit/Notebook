"Iteration is a very important concept in computer programming. Iteration is the process of executing a block of code over and over again until a condition is met. There are particular data types that are conducive to iterations; particularly data types with length properties such as strings and arrays. For loops are an example of iteration. For loops must define a starting location, a condition to be met that will end the loop, and what executable action will take place during the iteration.("https://github.com/learn-academy-2024-alpha/syllabus/blob/main/javascript/loops.md")

## Iteration
The process of performing an action a number of times or until a condition is met.  Most common form of iteration is a **for loop**.

**For Loop**: Defines a variable and increments or decrements the variable on each iteration.
***

## For Loop
Within JS, there are multiple types of loops.  Right now, we are focusing on For Loops.
For Loops are the most common type of iteration within JS.

It is the most common because it gives you the most control over how you are iterating over items by letting you define the following:

1. Where the count starts. The common variable name is `i` as loops are often used to connect to the index of an array.
2. How many iterations we want the loop to go through.
3. What action is performed each time.

Examples:
```js
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(i)
}
// output: 0 1 2 3 4
```
```js
for (let i = 10; i > 0; i--) {
  console.log(i)
}
// output: 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
```

For Loops shine when we need to iterate thru an array and do something with each element
```js
// Loop through and array of numbers and return each number multiplied by 3.

var arr = [5, 3, 2, 9]

for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  console.log(arr[i] * 3)
}
// output: 15 9 6 27
```

In the array above array[i] is the element at each index.  We are then multiplying each element by 3.
```js
arr[0] is 5 which becomes 5 * 3

arr[1] is 3 which becomes 3 * 3

arr[2] is 2 which becomes 2 * 3

arr[3] is 9 which becomes 9 * 3
```

We can also further filter thru the array using `if/else` statements
```js
// write a for loop that logs all numbers except 5.

var arr = [5, 3, 5, 2, 5, 7]

for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  if (arr[i] !== 5) {
    console.log(arr[i])
  }
}
// output: 3 2 7
```
Take notice of the indention in the code above.  This is done so that it is easier to see if we closed all of our open curly brackets.

## Scoped Variable Declarations

**Scope**: Where a variable is accessible or visible.  The two main types are as follows:

- **Global** - variables that can be seen and used anywhere in the program.
- **Local** - also know as lexical or block scope. Variables in local scope can only be used within the block, function, or loop where it was assigned.

Take note that in the loops we use `let` to assign `i` or `index` to a starting value.  In recent JS updates, `let` and `const` were added to help deal with scope issues.  Before that, only `var` could be used to assign variables.  This only allowed for global variables and sometimes came along with issues.

Now we have the following:
- **var** - puts the variable in global scope and may be reassigned.
- **let** - this means that the variable will only be used in the block in which it is defined. This also means that this variable could be reassigned elsewhere in your program.
- **const** - this means that the variable cannot be reassigned.

## Index - Need to Know
When doing this we will always need the following:
```js
let i = 0; i < 10; i + 1
```
1. Where to start `let i = 0` *Start at 0*
2. Where to stop `index < 10` *End before 10*
3. How to count `index + 1` *Count by 1*

## Challenges
- Create a for loop that logs each number from 1 - 20.
- Create a for loop that logs every other number from 1 - 20.
- Create a for loop that logs the result of each number from 1 - 20 tripled.
- Create a for loop that logs each even number from 1-20, and in the place of every odd number, returns the word "ODD".
    - Expected output: ODD, 2, ODD, 4, ODD, 6 ...etc

Consider this variable:

```js
const nums = [3, 57, -9, 20, 67]
```

- Create the code that will log the largest number from the array.
- Create the code that will log the smallest number from the array.
- Create the code that will log the remainder of each number when divided by 2.
    - Expected output: 1, 1, -1, 0, 1

Consider this variable:

```js
const myString = "learn student"
```

- Create the code that will log the number of times the letter "e" occurs in the string.
- Create the code that will log every other character in the string.

## Stretch Goals

- Create the code that iterates from 5 to 15. For each iteration log if the current number is odd or even.
    - Expected output: "5 is odd" "6 is even" "7 is odd" ...etc
- Fizz Buzz: Create the code that will iterate from 1-100. If a number is a multiple of 3, replace it with the word `fizz`. If a number is a multiple of five, replace it with the word `buzz`. If a number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, replace it with `fizzbuzz`.
    - Expected output: 1, 2, "fizz", 4, "buzz", "fizz", 7, 8, "fizz", "buzz", 11, "fizz", 13, 14, "fizzbuzz" ...etc
